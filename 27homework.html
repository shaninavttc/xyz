                <p>
                    A content management system (CMS) is a computer software used to manage the creation and
                    modification
                    of
                    digital content.
                    CMSs are typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content management (WCM).
                    ECM typically supports multiple users in a collaborative environment by integrating document
                    management,
                    digital asset management, and record retention.
                    Alternatively, WCM is the collaborative authoring for websites and may include text and embed
                    graphics,
                    photos, video, audio, maps, and program code that display content and interact with the user. ECM
                    typically includes a WCM function. CMS is a web template to create your own website.

                <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website
                    traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as
                    "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic. Unpaid traffic may
                    originate from different kinds of searches, including image search, video search, academic search,
                    news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines.</p>

                <p>Search engine marketing (SEM) is a form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites
                    by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs) primarily through paid
                    advertising.SEM may incorporate search engine optimization (SEO), which adjusts or rewrites website
                    content and site architecture to achieve a higher ranking in search engine results pages to enhance
                    pay per click (PPC) listings.

                <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers,
                    services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various
                    information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it
                    translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and
                    identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a
                    worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of
                    the functionality of the Internet since 1985.</p>

                <p>The HTTP 404, 404 Not Found, 404, 404 Error, Page Not Found or File Not Found error message is a
                    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard response code, in computer network communications, to
                    indicate that the browser was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find
                    what was requested. The error may also be used when a server does not wish to disclose whether it
                    has the requested information.
                    The website hosting server will typically generate a "404 Not Found" web page when a user attempts
                    to follow a broken or dead link; hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors
                    encountered on the World Wide Web.</p>

                    <p>E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling of products
                        on
                        online services or over the Internet. The term was coined and first employed by Dr. Robert
                        Jacobson,
                        Principal Consultant to the California State Assembly's Utilities & Commerce Committee, in the
                        title
                        and text of California's Electronic Commerce Act, carried by the late Commmittee Chairwoman Gwen
                        Moore (D-L.A.) and enacted in 1984. Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile
                        commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online
                        transaction
                        processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data
                        collection systems. E-commerce is in turn driven by the technological advances of the
                        semiconductor
                        industry, and is the largest sector of the electronics industry.</p>
